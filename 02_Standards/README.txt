02_Standards directory

This directory contains a series of scripts that compare babies' actual sleep with "normal" values from Ferber, M. (2006). Solve Your Childâ€™s Sleep Problems. New York: Simon and Schuster 

  01_setup.R - Creates subdirectories for saving script outputs.  Also creates a data frame containing the standards from the Ferber book, extrapolated for all days over the first 2 years.

  02_total_sleep.R - Analysis of total baby sleep in a 24 hour period.  Plots daily sleep and sleep distributions.  Also investigates a weekday (daycare) effect.

02_Standards is expected to be a subdirectory under the main project directory.
For relative paths, open the R project in RStudio.  The scripts in this directory will create and populate subdirectories under 00_Data and 00_Images.
