# Baby Sleep

Valerie Carey 2019

A personal data project to compare baby sleep recorded by parents to expert standards.  Written in R, and presented at the ROC data science meetup 28 Feb 2019.

Expects to use RStudio git integration, and references relative paths from the project head.  Will create files and directories under this project head.

To run code in this project, start at "01_Data_Input and run scripts in numerical order.

To add a baby for analysis, see instructions under "00_Data".  Data from one reference baby is included, and the scripts pull public data from another repository also (for 2 babies included by default).  

For now, the PowerPoint presentation in the top level is encrypted (PM for access).
